# Arduino Project with LDR and 7-Segment Display

This Arduino project utilizes a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure ambient light intensity and displays numbers from 0 to 9 on a 7-segment LED display. The code automatically maps the values read by the sensor to the desired range and lights up the corresponding LEDs to represent the number.

## Required Components

- Arduino (any compatible model)
- LDR Sensor
- 7-Segment Display with LEDs
- Resistors and jumpers as needed

## Setup

1. Connect the LDR sensor to an analog port on the Arduino (e.g., A5).
2. Connect the 7-segment display to the specified output pins in the code.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino using the IDE.

## Usage

Upon powering the project, the LDR sensor reads the ambient light intensity. The code maps this value to a number between 0 and 9 and lights up the LEDs on the 7-segment display according to the corresponding number.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests.
